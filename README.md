# NEWRPG

A top-down 2D RPG where you craft and cast powerful spells to interact with a dynamic, physics-based world.

## Inspiration

This project is heavily inspired by two games:

*   **CodeSpells:** The idea of writing your own magic and seeing it come to life is a core concept.
*   **Noita:** The deep, emergent physics and chemistry simulation that allows for creative problem-solving and chaotic fun.

## About the Game

In this game, you are a powerful mage exploring a dangerous world. Instead of finding pre-made spells, you will have the ability to craft your own by combining different elements and principles. The world is a sandbox for your magical creations, with a physics engine that allows for complex interactions between spells, the environment, and enemies.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Spell Crafting:** A system for creating unique spells.
*   **Physics-Based Magic:** Spells that interact with the world in emergent ways.
*   **Particle Engine:** A custom particle engine for beautiful and chaotic spell effects.
*   **Inventory System:** Manage your magical ingredients and artifacts.
*   **2D Graphics Engine:** A simple graphics engine to render the world.

## Building and Running

The project uses a `makefile` for building. To compile the game, simply run:

```bash
make
```

This will create an executable that you can run.
